/*
 - Identify models:
    - Device space and device apps for the device id
    - The download history for the device id
    - The queued apps for the device id
    - The available updates for the device id.
 
 - Mutate Actions:
    - Change the device -> - Need to refresh all the models.
                           - Refetch all the data
    - Device sync is done -> - The queue is consumed, refresh the queue
                             - The device apps and device space did update, refresh device info
                             - Refresh the updates list after the device info is refreshed.
                             - Download history should remain the same.
    - App uploaded to queue -> - The app is uploaded to queue (refetch the queue)
                               - If the app id is not in donwloaded apps refetch the downloaded history
                               - Sync with the device.
    - Uninstall app -> - The app is deleted from the device, refetch the device info.
                       - The download history remains the same.
                       - Remove the app for updates list if the app did have an update prior
                         to uninstalling.
                       - If an update was uploaded to queue for the uninstalled device,
                         remove the app from queue.
    - App deleted -> - Delete app from download history.
 
 - Services needed:
   - Current selected device provider.
   - Sync completion provider.
   - Install/delete/update api ops provider.
   - Uninstall app from device op provider.
